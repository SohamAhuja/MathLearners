<div class="heading"><b>Mensuration</b></div>
<div id="content">Mensuration is the branch of mathematics that studies the measurement of the 2D and 3D figures on parameters like length, volume, shape, surface area, etc. In other words, Mensuration can be explained as an act of measurement. We live in a three-dimensional world. The concept of measurement plays an important role in primary as well as secondary school mathematics. Moreover, measurement has a direct connection to our everyday lives. When learning to measure objects we learn to do so for both 3D shapes and 2D shapes. </div>
<br>
<div class="heading"><b>Uses of Mensuration</b></div>

Mensuration is an important topic with high applicability in real-life scenarios. Given below are some of the scenarios.
<br>
1.Measurement of agricultural fields, floor areas required for purchase/selling transactions.<br>
2.Measurement of volumes required for packaging milk, liquids, solid edible food items.<br>
3.Measurements of surface areas required for estimation of painting houses, buildings, etc.<br>
4.Volumes and heights are useful in knowing water levels and amounts in rivers or lakes.<br>
5.Optimum cost packaging sachets for milk etc. like tetra packing.<br>
<div class="heading"><b>Important Mensuration Terms</b></div>
<br>
<div class="heads">1.Area	<br></div>
Area is the amount of space occupied by a two-dimensional figure. It is expressed in square units.<br><br>
<div class="heads">2.Perimeter	<br></div>
Perimeter is the total distance around the shape or the length of the boundary of any closed shape.<br> It is expressed in square units.<br><br>
<div class="heads">3.Volume<br></div>
Volume is the amount of space occupied by a 3D shape. It is expressed in cubic meter.<br><br>
<div class="heads">4.Surface Area<br></div>
Surface Area is the total area occupied by the surfaces of a 3D object. They are classified into two - <br>Curved or Lateral Surface Area and Total Surface Area.
<div class="heading"><b>Mensuration Formulas</b></div>
Mensuration formulas involve both 3D and 2D shapes. The most commonly used formula is the surface area and volume of these shapes. However, let us learn all the formulas for these shapes.
<div class="heading"><b>3D Shape Formulas</b></div>

<div class="heads">	1.Sphere<br></div>
Diameter = 2 × r; (where 'r' is the radius)<br>
Surface Area = 4πr<sup>2</sup><br>
Volume = (4/3)πr<sup>3</sup><br>
<div class="heads">	2.Cylinder<br></div>
Total Surface Area = 2πr(h+r); (where 'r' is the radius and 'h' is the height of the cylinder)<br>
Volume = πr<sup>2</sup>h<br>
<div class="heads">3.Cone	<br></div>
Curved Surface Area = πrl; (where 'l' is the slant height and l = √(h<sup>2</sup> + r<sup>2</sup>))<br>
Total Surface Area = πr(l + r)<br>
Volume = (1/3)πr<sup>2</sup>h<br>
<div class="heads">	4.Cube<br></div>
Lateral Surface Area = 4a<sup>2</sup>; (where 'a' is the side length of the cube)<br>
Total Surface Area = 6a<sup>2</sup><br>
Volume = a<sup>3</sup><br>
<div class="heads">	5.Cuboid<br></div>
Lateral Surface Area = 2h(l + w); (where 'h' is the height, 'l' is the length and 'w' is the width)<br>
Total Surface Area = 2 (lw + wh + lh)<br>
Volume = (l × w × h)<br>
<div class="heads">	6.Prism<br></div>
Surface Area = [(2 × Base Area) + (Perimeter × Height)]<br>
Volume = (Base Area × Height)<br>
<div class="heads">	7.Pyramid<br></div>
Surface Area = Base Area + (1/2 × Perimeter × Slant Height)<br>
Volume = [(1/3) × Base Area × Altitude]<br><div class="heads">	<br></div>
<br>

<div class="heading"><b>2D Shape Formulas</b></div>
<div class="heads">1.Circle	<br></div>
A = π × r<sup>2</sup>, where 'r' is the radius of the circle and 'π' is a constant whose value is taken as 22/7 or 3.14<br>
Circumference (Perimeter) = 2πr<br>
<div class="heads">	2.Triangle<br></div>
Area = ½ (Base × height)	<br>
Perimeter = Sum of the three sides<br>
<div class="heads">	3.Square<br></div>
Area = Side<sup>2</sup>	<br>
Perimeter = 4 × side<br>
<div class="heads">4.Rectangle	<br></div>
Area = Length × Width	<br>
Perimeter = 2 (Length + Width)<br>
