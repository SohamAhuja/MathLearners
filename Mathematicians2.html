1. Euclid</div>
<img src="pics/m1.jpg"><br>
Euclid was one among the famous mathematicians, and he was known as the ‘Father of Geometry.’ His famous Geometry contribution is referred to as the Euclidean geometry, which is there in the Geometry chapter of class IX. He spent all his life working for mathematics and set a revolutionary contribution to Geometry. 
<div Class="head">
2. Pythagoras</div>
<img src="pics/m2.jpg"><br>
‘Pythagoras theorem’ is very popular and an important mathematical formula to solve mathematical problems. Since childhood, all of us have struggled to solve mathematical problems applying the Pythagoras theorem. Pythagoras discovered this prominent theorem and he became the father of ‘Pythagoras theorem.’ Pythagoras was from Greece, but he fled off to India in the latter part of his life.
<div Class="head">
3. Archimedes</div>
<img src="pics/m3.jpg"><br>
Archimedes was a Greek Scientist, a great mathematician, and a Physician. He also worked his entire life in search of discovering mathematical formulas that are related to Physics. The best contribution of Archimedes in mathematics is known as the invention of compound pulleys, antiquity, and screw pump. Students of class X have to study these chapters of compound pulleys and antiquity.
<div Class="head">
4. Thales of Miletus</div>
<img src="pics/m4.jpg"><br>
Thales of Miletus was one of the most famous mathematicians from Greece. He was very skilled in Geometry and used Geometry as a means to calculate the heights of pyramids and measure the distance of a ship from the shore. As he was also a philosopher, in the ‘Thales’ theorem’ he tries to apply Geometry by using deductive reasoning and derives the conclusion of four corollaries
<div Class="head">
5. Aristotle</div>
<img src="pics/m5.jpg"><br>
Aristotle was a great scholar and he had vast knowledge in various areas, including Physics, mathematics, geology, metaphysics, medicine, biology, and psychology. He was a student of Plato, and both of them together discovered many philosophical theories and contributed to mathematics and Platonism. He combines mathematics and philosophy and in his treaties, and uses mathematical science in three principal ways.
<div Class="head">
6. Diophantus</div>
<img src="pics/m6.jpg"><br>
His algebraic equations are quite easy and unique, so he was popularly known as the ‘Father of Algebra.’ He wrote a series of books on Algebra. He later gained popularity for his book Arithmetica, where a brief description with examples was given on the best solution for all the algebraic equations and the theory related to the number. 
<div Class="head">
7. Eratosthenes </div>
<img src="pics/m7.jpg"><br>
Eratosthenes was a world-famous mathematician known for his unbelievable and exact calculation. He was the only mathematician who put efforts to calculate the earth’s circumference and calculated the Earth’s axis tilt. Both his calculations are exact, and so he became famous worldwide.
<div Class="head">
8. Hipparchus</div>
<img src="pics/m8.jpeg"><br>
Like Geometry, trigonometry chapters are also important for class IX and X students. The founder of trigonometry was an intelligent mathematician and mythologist Hipparchus. He discovered the first trigonometric table in mathematics. He was the first person to develop a well-grounded process by which people can predict solar eclipses.
<div Class="head">
9. Hero of Alexandria</div>
<img src="pics/m9.jpg"><br>
Heron’s formula in mathematics is applied by students from class VI onwards. Yes, he was the one who discovered the square root of numbers. In today’s mathematics, his formula is known as Heron’s formula. So, he gained popularity and became known as the ‘Hero of Alexandria.’
<div Class="head">
10. Ptolemy</div>
<img src="pics/m10.jpg"><br>
Ptolemy was a mathematician; he was also a geographer, musician, writer, and astronomer. His contributions to mathematics were incredible. He wrote about mathematics, and among them, his best treaty was called Almagest. He also believed that in the Universe, the position of the Earth was in the center.
<div Class="head">
11. Xenocrates</div>
<img src="pics/m11.jpg"><br>
Xenocrates was a famous mathematician from Greek. He had written a series of books on mathematics. He emphasizes the theory of numbers in mathematics, and all his written books were based on the theory of numbers, and geometry. He could easily calculate the syllables from an alphabet. 
<div Class="head">
12. Anaxagoras</div>
<img src="pics/m12.jpeg"><br>
He was a great mathematician and an astronomer. Because of his outstanding knowledge of mathematics and cosmology, he discovered the exact clarification of eclipses and stated that the Sun is larger than Peloponnese. 
<div Class="head">
13. Hypatia</div>
<img src="pics/m13.jpg"><br>
She was a famous mathematician and a philosopher. She was the first woman to give importance to mathematics. She was a genius, and for many young women, she became an inspiration and encouraged them to pursue their dreams. In Alexandria's history, she was the last famous mathematician.
